The githubfinder.html uses the GitHub API to display information about
a given user. After retrieving input regarding
the username, the name is concatenated to the API link in order to fetch
data about the github user: their name, company, location, URL, and profile picture.
If the user does not have their name, company, or location listed, the results
will display "N/A". My GitHub is already filled in as a default demonstration.

The weatherfinder.html uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display information about
the weather of a given US City. After retrieving input regarding
the city, the city name is concatenated to the API link in order to fetch
data about the weather in that location: the city (as inputted), Weather, Wind Speed, and Temp(F).
If a city does not exist, the results will not be displayed (or will not change if input was previously provided) 
and the city will be labeled as undefined.
